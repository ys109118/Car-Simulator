# Car-Simulator
This project develops advanced AI for a car simulator game. The AI will:  Drive realistically: Navigate roads, follow traffic rules, react to traffic, and handle emergencies. Employ advanced techniques: Utilize machine learning (like reinforcement learning) and computer vision for realistic driving behavior. 
This project aims to develop an advanced AI system for a car simulator game, focusing on:

Realistic Driving Behavior:

Pathfinding and Navigation: Implement sophisticated pathfinding algorithms (e.g., A*, Dijkstra's) to enable AI-controlled vehicles to navigate complex road networks, including intersections, roundabouts, and highways.
Traffic Rules and Regulations: Train the AI to adhere to traffic laws (speed limits, lane discipline, right-of-way, etc.) and respond appropriately to traffic signals (stop signs, traffic lights).
Reactive Driving: Develop AI that can react dynamically to real-time traffic situations, such as:
Avoiding collisions: Predict and avoid potential collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
Overtaking: Safely overtake slower vehicles when appropriate.
Lane changing: Smoothly and safely change lanes to avoid congestion or prepare for turns.
Emergencies: Implement AI responses to emergency situations (e.g., sudden braking, swerving to avoid obstacles).
Advanced AI Techniques:

Machine Learning: Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning, deep learning) to train the AI on vast amounts of driving data. This will enable the AI to learn complex driving behaviors, adapt to different driving styles, and improve over time.
Computer Vision: Integrate computer vision techniques for object detection and recognition. This will allow the AI to perceive its surroundings accurately, identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs, and make informed driving decisions.
Game Integration:

Seamlessly integrate the AI system into a car simulator game environment.
Provide options for adjusting AI difficulty levels to cater to players of varying skill levels.
